		<p>Hi! I'm a 23 year old computer engineer that loves everything related with them. I'm a native of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_(greater_region)">Basque Country</a>, exactly from the town of <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/1n9Fm">Lekeitio</a>, in Biscay. Thus, I am a native speaker of both Basque and Spanish. I can also speak English fluently on an advanced level.</p>

		<p>I'm particularly interested in its interaction with society, in the forms of artificial intelligence, computational science, data mining, and so on. I also like the classics, though: programming, networking, software engineering, computer architecture, Operative Systems and Information security.</p>

		<p>I am a self-educated person: I like studying by myself (it's hard but highly rewarding), looking at some technologies or knowledge that have either not seen on class or being key to pursue my career.</p>

		<p>I don't like the "workaholic" philosophy but I get work done when it needs to be done, responsible but with no high pressure. Being stressed worsens the quality of the work.</p>

		<p>I, as a computer engineer, also like to do some coding in my spare time. You can see some in my <a href="https://github.com/jontxu">Github</a> profile.</p>
