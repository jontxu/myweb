			<p>Hi! I'm a 23 year old computer engineer that loves everything related with them. I'm a native of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_(greater_region)">Basque Country</a>, exactly from the town of <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/1n9Fm">Lekeitio</a>, in Biscay. Thus, I am a native speaker of both Basque and Spanish. I can also speak English fluently on an advanced level.</p>

			<p>I'm particularly interested in its interaction with society, in the forms of artificial intelligence, computational science, data mining, and so on. I also like the classics, though: programming, networking, software engineering, computer architecture, Operative Systems and Information security.</p>

			<p>I am a self-educated person: I like studying by myself (it's hard but highly rewarding), looking at some technologies or knowledge that have either not seen on class or being key to pursue my career.</p>

			<p>I don't like the "workaholic" philosophy but I get work done when it needs to be done, responsible but with no high pressure. Being stressed worsens the quality of the work.</p>
	
			<p>If you want to navigate through the page, the <b>Résumé</b> and <b>Contact</b> pages are self-explanatory. The <b>Skills</b> page shows the technologies that I'm mostly knowledgeable about, and the <b>Coding</b> page shows some work I've done for college or in my spare time.</p>

			<p>I also have a <a href="http://blog.jontxu.eu">blog</a> (static, with no comments), where I jot down some of my thoughs in a wide array of areas.</p>
