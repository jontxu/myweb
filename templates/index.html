	 <h2>About</h2>
	 	<h3>Disclaimer: not related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Jon_Juaristi">homonymous writer</a></h3>
		<p>I'm a Computer Engineer that loves everything related with them. Historically it has been a self-made industry, innovating for the sake of perpetuating. I'm interested in it's interaction with society, in the forms of artificial intelligence, computational science, data mining, and so on. I also like the classics, though: programming (desktop, mobile, web, CLI, ...), networking, software engineering, computer architecture, Operative Systems and Information security.</p>

		<p>I am a self-educated person: I like studying by myself (it's hard but highly rewarding), looking at some technologies or knowledge that have either not seen on class or being key to pursue my career.</p>

		<p>I don't like the "workaholic" philosophy but I get work done when it needs to be done, responsible but with no high pressure. Being stressed worsens the quality of the work.</p>

		<p>Finally, I like to do some coding in my spare time. You can see some in my <a href="https://github.com/jontxu">Github</a> profile.</p>
